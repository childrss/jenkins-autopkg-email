 * Every time I run a recipe it downloads something even if it didn't change. Why?
 *      https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/FAQ
 *
 * the IS_TROUBLEMAKER is a per-job environmental variable set using the 
 * Jenkins EnvInject Plugin -- https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/EnvInject+Plugin
 *
 * below is the elvis/ternary operator that does the following:
 * if IS_TROUBLEMAKER is set from the Jenkins job configuration, take that value
 * (it should be true).  If it's not set/doesn't exist, set it to false
 * because we have a lot of existing jobs and only set the IS_TROUBLEMAKER on jobs that
 * ARE troublemakers!
